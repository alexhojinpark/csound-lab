# Csound Lab

A comprehensive collection of sound synthesis techniques implemented in Csound, organized by synthesis method.

## Overview

This repository contains professional sound synthesis implementations covering fundamental to advanced techniques in digital audio processing. Each folder focuses on a specific synthesis method with practical examples and interactive controllers.

## Synthesis Techniques

- **01_Basic_Synthesis** - Fundamental oscillators, envelopes, and noise generation
- **02_Wavetable_Synthesis** - Wavetable synthesis and interactive controllers
- **03_Additive_Synthesis** - Harmonic series synthesis, bells, and Shepard tones
- **04_Subtractive_Synthesis** - Filter-based synthesis, vocoders, and percussion
- **05_FM_Synthesis** - Frequency modulation synthesis (Chowning techniques)
- **06_Phase_Modulation** - Phase modulation and waveshaping synthesis
- **07_Granular_Synthesis** - Granular synthesis and live performance tools
- **08_Formant_Synthesis** - FOF formant synthesis for vocal modeling
- **09_Spectral_Processing** - Spectral processing and PVOC operations
- **10_MIDI_Performance** - MIDI performance instruments and controllers
- **11_Live_Performance** - Live coding and performance templates
- **12_Compositions** - Complete musical compositions and final projects

## Requirements

- Csound 6.0 or later
- CsoundQt (recommended for GUI-based instruments)

## Usage

Each folder contains README files with detailed explanations of the synthesis techniques and file descriptions. Most instruments can be run directly with Csound or through CsoundQt for interactive control.
